The power strike power attack has a melee range equal to that weapon’s melee range. Its target must be in the Open Fist’s field of  fire and have a smaller base than the colossal.\n\nThe colossal makes a melee attack against the target. If the attack hits, the target is slammed d6 + 2˝ directly away from the colossal and suffers a power attack damage roll.\n\nSWEEP – A colossal chooses a non-crippled melee weapon with a location of L or R to make a sweep power attack. It makes one melee attack with the weapon against each model in the weapon’s field of fire that is within the weapon’s melee range, ignoring intervening models when determining LOS. This power attack does not require a target, but each separate attack does. These attacks are simultaneous.

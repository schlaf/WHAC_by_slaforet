<h3>Beware! in order to work, this app needs at least <i>once</i> a data connection (preferably Wifi) to download the models' data. After that, it can work offline if you choose. Set up your download prefs using the "import data" button.</h3>

<h4>Please note that this is an EXPERIMENTAL version, provided "as is" until further completion. Please be kind not to rate "1-star" on first bug, especially since the app is free and the data is community-managed.</h4>

<b>What's new in 2.0.0 Final</b><br>

<ul>
    <li/>new database with some more metadata (card version, proofreading status)
    <li/>implements MK3
    <li/>new card display (new abilities, weapon range, ...)
</ul>
and ...
<ul>
    <li/>now fetch data from an online database
    <li/>no more need to manually import data files
    <li/>also, data is dynamic, so a correction is ok for every model using it
    <li/>support translated data cards (actually, english and french)
    <li/>still the same app, mostly...
</ul>
still to do
<ul>
    <li/>waiting for theme forces rules...
    <li/>cephalyx contract currently as in mk2, so probably not really working
    <li/>some models may still be a bad copy from mk2 or missing.
    <li/>no automatic inclusion of "companion" models (brine, snapjaw, belphagor, laris, ...) but they can be added at no cost manually
    <li/>some rules are not correctly implemented (like an unit which can be a caster attachment, or some weird thing like that)
    <li/>cavalry models do not have the mount weapon correctly displayed
</ul>

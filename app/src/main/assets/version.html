</ul>
and ...

</ul>
still to do
<ul>
    <li/>waiting for theme forces rules...

    <li/>some models may still be a bad copy from mk2 or missing.
    <li/>no automatic inclusion of "companion" models (brine, snapjaw, belphagor, laris, ...) but they can be added at no cost manually
    <li/>some rules are not correctly implemented (like an unit which can be a caster attachment, or some weird thing like that)
    <li/>cavalry models do not have the mount weapon correctly displayed
</ul>

but they also now provide the bonus text. Also, there is some new theme forces available.
<li/>The theme forces now can handle "textual" description of limitations, so you will get something like "non character warjacks" instead of
the complete list of warjacks available.
<li/>And, you can import theme forces files, so you can get new themes and/or corrections the same ways you do with cards.
<li/>You can now save many battle results with the same army list (same list played against various opponents)
<li/>Last, but not least : you can add cards in battle mode (hello popping shredders!) : find the card in the library, then long-press to add to your troops.
